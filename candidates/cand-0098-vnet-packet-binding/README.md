# cand-0098-vnet-packet-binding

Intent: P1 soundness: fundraise VNET proof must bind the packet (derive Prover.toml from vnet_link; kill the static-witness bypass)

Status: open (pre-threshold).

## Optional RLM Trace Evidence

When model-assisted or large-context reasoning materially supports this candidate,
keep that support in checking mode: generate an explicit trace with
`tools/eval/rlm-trace-from-candidate.sh`, check it with
`sites/eval/realizations/rlm-trace-profile-check/rlm-trace-profile-check.sh`,
and store the JSONL plus checker output under `traces/` before attestation.
A passing RLM trace is evidence only; it does not grant answer authority,
KB admission, Boat candidate admission, Harbor readiness, live LLM calls,
provider calls, network access, shell access, or secret access.
